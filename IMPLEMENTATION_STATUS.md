# Multi-Tenant Flat & Bill Management System

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Completed
- Laravel 10 project setup with Tailwind CSS
- Database schema with proper migrations for multi-tenant architecture
- Eloquent models with relationships and global scopes for data isolation
- Service-Repository pattern implementation
- Multi-tenant middleware

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Authentication system with role-based permissions

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- Controllers with CRUD operations
- Tailwind CSS views (forms and tables)
- Email notifications (bill creation/payment)
- Database seeders with sample data
- Comprehensive documentation

## Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **users** - Admin and House Owner roles
2. **buildings** - Owned by house owners
3. **flats** - Belong to buildings, contain owner details
4. **tenants** - Assigned to flats by admin
5. **bill_categories** - Created by house owners (Electricity, Gas, Water, Utility)
6. **bills** - Generated for flats with due management

## Multi-Tenant Implementation

- **Column-based tenancy** using `house_owner_id`
- **Global scopes** on all models for automatic data filtering
- **Middleware** for additional tenant validation
- **Admin bypass** capability for system management

## Service-Repository Pattern

```php
App/
â”œâ”€â”€ Contracts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BaseRepositoryInterface.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BuildingRepositoryInterface.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FlatRepositoryInterface.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BillRepositoryInterface.php
â”œâ”€â”€ Repositories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BaseRepository.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BuildingRepository.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FlatRepository.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BillRepository.php
â””â”€â”€ Services/
    â”œâ”€â”€ BaseService.php
    â””â”€â”€ BuildingService.php
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Laravel Breeze** for authentication
2. **Create Controllers** using dependency injection with services
3. **Build Tailwind Views** with responsive forms and tables
4. **Implement Email Notifications** using Laravel's mail system
5. **Create Seeders** with sample data
6. **Write Documentation** and export SQL

## Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Tenant Security
- House owners can only access their own data
- Admin can manage all data across tenants
- Automatic scoping at model level

### Business Logic
- Automatic bill total calculation (amount + due_amount)
- Tenant assignment to flats
- Bill category management per house owner
- Due amount forwarding for unpaid bills

### Performance Optimization
- Proper database indexing
- Eager loading relationships
- Query optimization with scopes
